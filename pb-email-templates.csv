HANGING YOUR ARTWORK

• Note: Sorry—no free entry for assistants or plus-ones.

SALES & PAYMENTS
You manage your own sales and keep 100% of what you sell.

Now that you're officially confirmed for The [eventName], we want to walk through the logistical ""Playbook"" so you can prep your setup.

Because we are limited on the number of vendors we can host at [venue], space is optimized for flow and visibility. Please review these requirements carefully.

1. YOUR SPACE & FOOTPRINT
• Dimensions: Your space is approximately 8ft wide x 5ft deep.
• Placement: Locations are assigned first-come, first-served during load-in. If you want a specific spot, arrive early.
• No Wall Art: This space is for non-hangable items (jewelry, apparel, etc.). You cannot use the gallery walls for canvases or hanging art unless you have also been accepted as an artist and have already paid your exhibition fees.

2. EQUIPMENT: WHAT TO BRING
We do not provide any furniture or display hardware. You are responsible for:
• Table & Chair: One 6ft table and your own seating.
• Displays: Grid walls or clothing racks are permitted as long as they stay within your 8x5 footprint.
• Lighting: The venues are often ""moody"" (dim). We highly recommend bringing battery-powered lights for your display.
• Power: Outlets are not guaranteed at every spot. If you need power, please bring a long extension cord and power strip.

3. PROHIBITED ITEMS
• No Tents: Tents/canopies are not permitted indoors.
• No Wall Damage: Do not drill, glue, or attach anything to the venue walls.

4. SALES & ENTRY
• 0% Commission: You keep 100% of your sales. Please have your Venmo/Square/Zelle QR codes ready.
• Entry: Your space includes one (1) free entry for yourself. All assistants, staff, or guests must purchase a ticket to enter.

What's Next? We will send a final email 2–3 days before the show with the specific load-in address, parking instructions, and final arrival times.
